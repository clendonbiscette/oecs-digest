## Database Design Highlights

### Normalized Structure
- **20+ data tables** (one per major data collection point)
- **Composite unique constraints** prevent duplicate entries
- **Foreign keys** ensure referential integrity
- **Check constraints** validate data ranges

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Academic Year Storage:** String format (e.g., "2023-2024") for flexibility
2. **Calculated Fields:** NOT stored in database, computed in application layer
3. **Gender Totals:** NOT stored, calculated as Male + Female
4. **Cross-Tabulation:** Stored normalized (one row per combination), pivoted for display
5. **Ownership Totals:** Public and Private stored separately, totals calculated

### Performance Optimization
- **Indexes** on country_id + year for all data tables
- **Views** for common aggregations
- **Partitioning strategy** (by academic year) for scaling
- **Caching recommendations** for reference data

### Data Quality
- **NOT NULL constraints** on required fields
- **CHECK constraints** for valid ranges (e.g., counts >= 0)
- **Unique constraints** prevent duplicates
- **Foreign keys** ensure valid references
- **Application-level validations** for cross-field checks

---

## Data Migration Strategy

### Importing Historical Excel Data

If historical data exists in Excel format:

1. **Parse Excel Files**
   - Use openpyxl or pandas to read Excel
   - Identify worksheet and cell ranges
   - Extract data with proper typing

2. **Validate Data**
   - Check for required fields
   - Validate against database constraints
   - Flag anomalies for manual review

3. **Transform Data**
   - Convert Excel structure to normalized database rows
   - Handle merged cells appropriately
   - Calculate age ranges from specific ages if needed

4. **Load into Database**
   - Use batch inserts for performance
   - Handle conflicts (update if exists)
   - Log any errors or warnings

5. **Verify**
   - Compare totals between Excel and database
   - Spot-check random samples
   - Generate validation report

**Sample Import Script Structure:**
```python
import openpyxl
import psycopg2

def parse_institutions_sheet(workbook, country_id, year):
    ws = workbook['Institutions']
    data = []
    for row in range(6, 13):  # Data rows
        level = ws.cell(row, 1).value
        public = ws.cell(row, 2).value or 0
        private_assisted = ws.cell(row, 3).value or 0
        private_unaffiliated = ws.cell(row, 4).value or 0

        data.extend([
            (country_id, year, level, 'public', public),
            (country_id, year, level, 'private_assisted', private_assisted),
            (country_id, year, level, 'private_unaffiliated', private_unaffiliated)
        ])

    return data

# Similar functions for other worksheets...
```

---

## Validation Rules

### Database Level (SQL Constraints)
```sql
-- Non-negative counts
CHECK (count >= 0)

-- Valid age ranges
CHECK (age >= 0 AND age <= 89)

-- Unique combinations
UNIQUE(country_id, academic_year, education_level, gender)
```

### Application Level (Business Logic)
```javascript
// Totals must match components
if (male + female !== total) {
  errors.push("Total must equal Male + Female");
}

// Enrollment totals consistency
if (sumByAge !== sumByGrade) {
  warnings.push("Age totals don't match Grade totals");
}

// Year-over-year change warning
if (Math.abs(currentYear - previousYear) / previousYear > 0.5) {
  warnings.push("Enrollment changed by >50% from previous year");
}

// Required fields
if (!value && field.required) {
  errors.push(`${field.name} is required`);
}
```

### Client-Side (Immediate Feedback)
- Field-level validation on blur
- Form-level validation on submit
- Visual indicators (red border for errors, yellow for warnings)
- Helpful error messages
- Prevent submission if errors exist

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Password complexity requirements
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Row-level security (users only see their country's data)
- Action-level permissions (can edit vs can approve)
- API endpoint protection

### Data Protection
- HTTPS only (TLS 1.3)
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection (input sanitization, CSP headers)
- CSRF protection (tokens)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Audit Trail
- Log all data changes (who, what, when)
- Store old and new values
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Export audit logs for compliance

### Backup & Recovery
- Daily automated backups
- Backup retention (7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly)
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Backup verification (restore tests)
- Offsite backup storage
