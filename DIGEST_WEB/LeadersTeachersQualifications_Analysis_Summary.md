## Excel Export Considerations

### Cell Writing Strategy

**For each input field:**
1. Get value from form
2. Map to exact Excel cell reference (use JSON mapping)
3. Write value to cell
4. Preserve cell formatting

**For formula fields:**
1. DO NOT write values
2. Preserve existing formulas exactly
3. Let Excel recalculate automatically

### Merged Cells Handling

**The worksheet contains 100+ merged cell ranges. Key examples:**

```
Table Headers:
- E6:G6 (Administrators)
- H6:J6 (Deputy Principal)
- K6:M6 (Care Givers/Teachers)

Section Titles:
- A5:D5 (Table B1 title)
- A24:D24 (Table B2 title)
- A111:I111 (Table B7 title)

Row Spans:
- A8:A22 (Pre-schools & Daycares stage span)
- A27:A42 (PRIMARY level span)
```

**Export strategy:**
- Use openpyxl's merged cell preservation
- Write to anchor cell (top-left of merged range)
- Don't attempt to write to merged cell children

### Formula Preservation Example

**When exporting to Excel:**

```python
# CORRECT approach
if cell_has_formula:
    # Skip - formula already exists in template
    continue
else:
    # Write user input value
    ws[cell_ref] = user_value

# INCORRECT approach - DO NOT DO THIS
ws[cell_ref] = calculated_value  # This destroys the formula!
```

### File Format

- Use `.xlsx` format (not `.xls`)
- Use `openpyxl` library (recommended)
- Load template file first, modify, then save
- Never create new workbook from scratch

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Data Validation Tests

**Field-Level Tests:**
- [ ] All 314 input fields accept numeric values
- [ ] Negative numbers are rejected
- [ ] Non-numeric input is rejected
- [ ] Large numbers (>9999) trigger warning

**Calculation Tests:**
- [ ] All Total columns calculate correctly (Male + Female)
- [ ] All Totals rows calculate correctly (Public + Private)
- [ ] B5 row 90 sums correctly (Primary + Secondary totals)
- [ ] B6 row 108 sums all specializations
- [ ] B2 row 42 formulas work (leadership degrees)
- [ ] B3 row 65 formulas work (leadership degrees)

**Export Tests:**
- [ ] Exported Excel file opens without errors
- [ ] All formulas intact and working
- [ ] Merged cells preserved correctly
- [ ] Cell formatting preserved
- [ ] File can be re-imported for editing
- [ ] OECS staff can open and use the file

**Cross-Table Tests:**
- [ ] B1-B3 use correct column structure (E-M)
- [ ] B4 uses correct column structure (D-L)
- [ ] B5 grid layout works for all 4 education stages
- [ ] B6 handles all 14 specializations
- [ ] B7 accepts CPD values in column J

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **All zeros:** User enters 0 for all fields
2. **Very large numbers:** User enters 9999+ values
3. **Partial completion:** User completes only some tables
4. **Unknown qualification rows:** How to handle "Unknown" category
5. **Reserved specializations:** B6 rows 106-107 left blank
6. **Mixed data:** Some roles have data, others don't

## Integration with Larger System

### OECS Aggregation Context

From CLAUDE.md, this worksheet data will be aggregated into:
- **Chapter 2 - Leaders and Teachers** (19 tables + Master sheet)
- Data from 9 OECS Member States (ANG, A&B, DOM, GRD, MON, SKN, SLU, SVG, VI)
- Multi-year tracking (2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23)

**Implications for this form:**
- Data must be complete and accurate for regional aggregation
- Gender disaggregation is critical (used in summary indicators)
- Qualification levels must match regional chapter structure
- Professional development metrics feed into performance indicators

## Questions for Product Owner / Users

1. **Required vs Optional Fields:**
   - Should all 314 fields be required?
   - Or can some be left blank (representing no data)?
   - Should 0 be allowed as a valid entry?

2. **Unknown Qualification Category:**
   - How should "Unknown" rows be handled?
   - Are these expected to be rare or common?

3. **Reserved Specializations (B6):**
   - Should users be able to add custom specializations?
   - Or are rows 106-107 just for future official additions?

4. **Leadership Degree Rows:**
   - Are these critical fields or optional?
   - Should they be prominently highlighted?

5. **Data Entry Workflow:**
   - Can users save partial progress?
   - Should there be a review/preview step before final submission?
   - Who validates the data before submission to OECS?

6. **Multi-Year Data:**
   - Will users need to enter data for multiple years?
   - Should previous years' data be visible for reference?
