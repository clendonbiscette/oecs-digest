# Leaders, Teachers & Qualifications Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete implementation of the LeadersTeachersQualifications worksheet (Tables B1-B7) including database schema and web form.

## Database Schema
**Location:** `supabase-staff-qualifications-table.sql`

### Tables Created:
1. **staff_qualifications** - Tables B1-B4 (Pre-schools, Primary, Secondary, Post-secondary)
   - Tracks: education_level, ownership_type, role, qualification_category, gender, count
   - Covers: Graduate/Non-graduate × Trained/Untrained combinations

2. **leadership_degree_holders** - Special field in B2 (row 42) and B3 (row 65)
   - Tracks principals/deputies with leadership/management/administration degrees
   - Fields: education_level, role, gender, count

3. **teacher_academic_qualifications** - Table B5
   - Tracks highest academic qualification of teachers
   - 9 qualification levels: CSEC, CAPE, Certificate, Associate, Bachelors, Postgraduate, Masters, Other, Unknown
   - Across 4 education stages: Pre-primary, Primary, Secondary, Post-secondary

4. **specialist_teachers** - Table B6
   - 14 specialization areas: Agriculture, French, Home Economics, IT, Music, PE & Sports, Plumbing, Reading, Spanish, Special Education, Theatre Arts, HFLE, + 2 custom slots

5. **professional_development** - Table B7

### Features:
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Country-specific data access control
- Automatic timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
- Performance indexes on country_id and academic_year_id
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate entries

## Web Form
**Location:** `app/data-entry/staff-qualifications/page.tsx`

### Form Structure:
- **7 Tabs** matching Excel tables B1-B7
- **Real-time totals** - Male + Female = Total (auto-calculated)
- **Gender disaggregation** throughout all tables
- **Public/Private split** for B1-B4
- **Auto-save functionality** with last-saved timestamp

### Table Details:

#### B1: Pre-schools
- Roles: Administrators, Deputy Principal, Care Givers
- 5 qualification levels per role
- Public and Private ownership types

#### B2: Primary
- Roles: Principal, Deputy Principal, Teachers
- 5 qualification levels per role
- Leadership degree tracking for principals
- Public and Private ownership types

#### B3: Secondary
- Roles: Principal, Deputy Principal, Teachers
- 5 qualification levels per role
- Leadership degree tracking for principals AND deputy principals
- Public and Private ownership types

#### B4: Post-secondary/Tertiary
- Roles: Principal, Deputy Principal, Teachers
- 2 qualification levels: Graduate, Non-graduate (NO trained/untrained split)
- Public and Private ownership types

#### B5: Teacher Academic Qualifications
- Wide table with 4 education stages as columns
- 9 qualification levels as rows
- Male/Female/Total for each stage

#### B6: Specialist Teachers
- 14 specialization rows
- Simple Male/Female/Total columns

#### B7: Continuous Professional Development
- 4 simple input fields
- No gender disaggregation (total participants only)

## Data Flow
1. **Load:** Fetches existing data from 5 tables on page load
2. **Edit:** Updates stored in React state (Maps for efficient lookup)
3. **Save:** Deletes existing records → Inserts new data (upsert pattern)
4. **Validation:** Only non-zero values saved to database

## Cell Mapping Reference
**Location:** `DIGEST_WEB/LeadersTeachersQualifications_CellMapping.json`

Complete mapping of Excel cell ranges to database fields:
- Exact row numbers for each qualification level
- Column letters for Male/Female/Total
- Role groupings and ownership types
- Special fields (leadership degrees, CPD metrics)

## Key Implementation Notes

### Data Types:
- **education_level:** 'pre_primary', 'primary', 'secondary', 'post_secondary'
- **ownership_type:** 'public', 'private'
- **roles:** 'principal', 'deputy_principal', 'teacher', 'administrator', 'care_giver'
- **qualification_category:**
  - B1-B3: 'graduate_trained', 'graduate_untrained', 'non_graduate_trained', 'non_graduate_untrained', 'unknown'
  - B4: 'graduate', 'non_graduate'
- **gender:** 'male', 'female'

### Unique Constraints:
Each table has a composite unique constraint ensuring no duplicate entries for the same:
- Country + Academic Year + specific dimension combinations

### Excel Formula Preservation:
- Totals calculated client-side in real-time
- Grand totals across ownership types shown per education level
- Subtotals per role category

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Run SQL schema in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Verify table creation and RLS policies
3. Test form with sample data entry
4. Verify save/load functionality
5. Check data integrity across all 7 tables
6. Test public/private split calculations
7. Validate leadership degree tracking
8. Confirm CPD metrics storage

## Excel Compatibility
Form matches exact structure of "LeadersTeachersQualifications" worksheet:
- Same qualification categories
- Same role groupings
- Same public/private divisions
- Same gender disaggregation
- Equivalent total calculations
